Cookie consent is the legal requirement to obtain consent from website visitors before setting cookies on their devices. Consent is collected via a cookie banner that enables visitors to accept or decline cookies on the website.

Privacy regulations like the GDPR in the EU and UK, LGPD in Brazil, POPIA in South Africa and similar laws around the world require businesses to get consent for collecting a userâ€™s personal data. As cookies and trackers can store personal data and be used to identify an individual, they are considered part of personal data.
